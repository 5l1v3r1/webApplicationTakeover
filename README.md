## Web Application Takeover via (not so) vulnerable file upload feature
Vanilla PHP based application containing the challenge of taking over Web Application via Shell Upload (vulnerable file upload feature) (docker image &amp; documentation will be available at: https://pentestlabs.gitbook.io/challenges/)

The challenge can be deployed with the following one liner:
```bash
docker run -it --rm uexpl0it/web-application-takeover
```

You can find me [@syed__umar](https://twitter.com/syed__umar) and the challenges @ [PentestLabs](https://pentestlabs.gitbook.io/challenges/). The challenge was inspired by [OWASP SKF](https://owasp-skf.gitbook.io/) and I'll be creating more like these in the near future, stay tuned! 

Also, thanks to everyone who did the challenges previously, especially [@makman](https://twitter.com/themakmaniac) for helping me through the PHP code, [@dodain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moizimtiazkhan/) for suggestions in the previous challenge & to [obnoxious-spirit](https://github.com/obnoxious-spirit/) for DockerFile's improvements.
